This repository is a simple web project, crafted with care using **HTML** and **CSS**. If you're looking for a clear, straightforward, and human example of a website, you've come to the right place! 😄

This project serves as a foundation for static websites: whether it's a portfolio, personal page, landing page, or any other simple site you want to get online quickly.  
Here, the focus is on learning, experimenting, and having fun with HTML and CSS—no complications!

> **Fun fact:** Over the last few months, I've been playing FragPunk and it's been amazing and addictive! If you like fast-paced games, I highly recommend checking it out.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
